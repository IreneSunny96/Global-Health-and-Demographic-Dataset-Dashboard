## Background
The dashboard has been developed as required by the Data Visualisation Coursework offered as part of Master in Data Science and Business Analytics offered by Centrale Supelec and ESSEC Business School, France.

## Goal of the Project
The Global Health and Demographic Dashboard is designed to explore the intricate relationships between health expenditures, immunization rates, socioeconomic factors, and their collective impact on life expectancy globally. The aim is to provide insights into how different countries prioritize their socio-economic resources and to visualize the outcomes of these investments in terms of public health and national development.

## Data Description
The project utilizes the "Health and Demographics Dataset," which encompasses data from 2000 to 2014. It includes measures of health expenditures, educational attainment, disease prevalence, and immunization rates, obtained from reliable sources like WHO, The World Bank, and United Nations databases. With 1649 instances spread over 22 columns, the dataset provides a historical perspective on global health trends, serving as a benchmark for evaluating health policies' progress and long-term effects.

## Framework Used for Development
The dashboard was developed using Streamlit, a powerful Python framework that enables the rapid creation of interactive web applications. Streamlit is chosen for its ease of use, flexibility, and capability to turn data scripts into shareable web apps quickly. It allows for seamless integration of complex Python libraries and visualization tools, facilitating an intuitive user experience.

## Use Case
This dashboard is valuable for policymakers, public health officials, researchers, and educators to:

Understand the dynamics of life expectancy and health outcomes.
Analyze the effectiveness of health expenditures and education.
Visualize disparities between different nations and demographics.
Inform public health strategies and educational initiatives.
The dashboard provides a narrative that contextualizes complex data, allowing users to recognize patterns, trends, and outliers through intuitive visualizations.

## Key Features and Advantages
- Interactivity: Allows users to explore data through filters and interactive elements, providing a tailored experience.
- Visualizations: Employs a range of charts and maps to represent data effectively, enhancing comprehension.
- Accessibility: The dashboard is web-based, ensuring access to anyone with an internet connection.
- Real-time Insights: Reflects changes immediately upon adjustment of parameters or filters.
